# NuGet Packages

## Unity Container 
Container is organized into set of two assemblies:
* [Unity.Abstractions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity.Abstractions/)
* [Unity.Container](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity.Container/)

These assemblies are distributed individually as well as a composite package containing both.

* [Unity](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity/)

This division is created to allow independence between declaration and implementation of container.
