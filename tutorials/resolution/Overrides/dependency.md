# Dependency Override

DependencyOverride enables you to specify an override of the registered value injected for the specified dependency type, and enables you to pass in a different object that will be provided by type. The use of the OnType method enables you to constrain the override to a specified type with the dependency instead of being propagated throughout all types with the dependency.
